ERROR: After October 2020 you may experience errors when installing or updating packages. This is because pip will change the way that it resolves dependency conflicts.

We recommend you use --use-feature=2020-resolver to test your packages with the new resolver before it becomes the default.

networkx 2.5.1 requires decorator<5,>=4.3, but you'll have decorator 5.0.6 which is incompatible.
